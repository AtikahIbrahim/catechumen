Stated below details/info as per requested:

A-Description on forms and reports, which already are being taken care of by the existing thumbprint system.

1. To provide record searching as follows (in 1 page):
Tester/user requested for record searching using multiple filter (department,name, time range) plus multiple method of sorting. (already in Thumbprint system but - to works with other comments).

Carian rekod kedatangan staf : <tarikh mula>-<tarikh akhir>, berdasarkan department & nama seperti yang dilampirkan

7. Borang Kenyataan Fingerprint
Currently this is a manual form. All/any staff who failed to thumbprint either log-in or log-out on their working days are required to fill-in this form [step 2]. This form will be attached with staff attendance listing (generated from Thumbprint system) [step 1] & submitted to their superior for approval [step 3]. Once approved, staff will submit approved form to Staff Attendance Administrator [step 4].
In ICMS - Tester requested to have this form in the system, where all/any staff can fill-in reasons(status) & all details(+ date & time) for not thumbprint cases, submit & get approval from their superior. Approval details will be received by both staff & Staff Attendance Administrator.
8. Attandance listing generated from thumb print system: (refercurrentmanualsystem-step6)
In manual system, upon receival of approved 'Borang Kenyataan Fingerprint' (+staff attendance listing), Staff Attendance Administrator will key-in ALL received data into thumbprint system. ONCE IN 2 WEEK(I may not mentioned this before), Staff Attendance Administrator will generate attendance listing (report from thumbprint system) & highlight these 3 cases :
late without reason
logged-in but didn't logged-out & vice versa
have no log record of 1 day at all & have no thumb print form 
Attendance listing (report) with above 3 highlighted cases will be submitted to Mdm Yap and Puan Norsidah accordingly. Mdm Yap and Puan Norsidah will fill-in manual form 'laporan mingguan (2 minggu)' and 'laporan bulanan'.
In ICMS, based on approval details (for not thumbprint cases) + access to all staff attendance, Staff Attendance Administrator will be able to generate :
Laporan Mingguan (2 minggu)
Laporan Bulanan
Laporan Status Punch Card

9. LaporanMingguan(Setiap2Minggu)
Expected output in A4 size paper.
10. Laporan Bulanan (same as above – item no. 10 except for it's title)
Expected output in A4 size paper. (Title : Laporan Bulanan)
11. (Item 3) To provide 'laporan status punch card' (printable) as follows 
Tester/user requested for 'Laporan Status Punch Card' as defined in Technical Specification:
Yelow-Green : Late for 3 times in a month - mark as green (by end of the month - no additional late - carry green card status for the next month)
Green-Red : For green card holder, 2 additional late - mark as red 
Red-Green : tiada catitan merah (no additional late) selepas sebulan memegang KPW merah
Green-Yellow : tiada catitan merah (no additional late) selepas sebulan memegang kad hijau
This 'laporan status punch card' - for all staff.

Item 8 - sample of generated report retrieved from thumbprint system.
Item 9 - expected output in A4 size paper
