Dimetradon

DAI-MET_RA-DON

Dimetradon is not a dinosaur, It lived 280 million in North Africa. It is about the size of a Komodo Dragon, but with a giant sail on his back.

Dimetradon means 'two types of teeth'.  It had long sharp teeth in from and shorter round teeth at the back, just like us.

The fierce Dimetradon was a predator and more closely related to mammals than dinosaurs.

They dissappeared during the Permian mass extinction.
